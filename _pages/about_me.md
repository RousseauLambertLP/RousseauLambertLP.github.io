I'm a geospatial specialist working for Environment and Climate Change Canada. I have a Bachelor degree in applied geomatics from Sherbrooke University where I graduated in August 2016 and am presently doing my Master (also in geomatic stuff) in Laval University where I should graduate somewhere in 2020 (hopefully!).

At work, I spend most of my days developping, fixing and improving our Geospatial Web services: [GeoMet](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/geospatial-web-services.html). Our GeoMet services does WMS, WFS and WCS. Our GeoMets use MapServer for serving WMS and the configuration constantly needs to be updated, thanks to the meteorological datasets which changes at various time ranging from minutes to days.

We also like to think at the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) that we have the first implementation of [WFS 3](http://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet/features/?f=html) and the biggest WMS services in the world with around 6000 layers on 2 WMS endpoint:
* [GeoMet-Weather](http://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities&version=1.3.0) (2.0.7): 2821 layers (even more to come :) )
* [GeoMet-Climate](http://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet-climate?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities&version=1.3.0) (1.2.0): 3132 layers

What I do when I'm not working ? Well, I love outdoors, so hiking, camping and I like to take a few pictures while I'm outside. I also like playing sports: hockey, running, swimming, tennis, etc.

Feel free to contact me for a question or a simple chat :)
